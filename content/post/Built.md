*Under development.* This page is an overview of the main components of RsyncOSX and RsyncUI. The development of the apps has been an evolving process. The open source community has been and still are a great resource for ideas and how to solve spesific tasks. Both apps are today stable and in a state of maintenace. Some numbers:

| App      | Lines of code | Swift files |
| ----------- | ----------- |   ----------- |
| RsyncOSX   | about 160K   | 130       |
| RsyncUI   | about 170K        | 170       |

## RsyncOSX vs RsyncUI

RsyncOSX and RsyncUI shares most of the code for the model components. RsyncOSX is a pure Swift and Storyboard based macOS application. RsyncUI is a pure SwiftUI and Swift based macOS application.  Both apps utilizes another great declarative library Combine developed by Apple. As well as JSON files for storing tasks, logrecords and user configuration. The main difference between the two apps is the UI part and how the UI is designed and built. 


| App      | Code | Paradigm |
| ----------- | ----------- |   ----------- |
| RsyncOSX   | Swift, Storyboard   | imperativ (Swift)      |
| RsyncUI   | SwiftUI, Swift | declarativ  (SwiftUI)     |

### RsyncOSX and Storyboard

*RsyncOSX* utilizes Storyboard, which is a tool for graphical design of views. All UI components like buttons, tables and other UI components are added and placed within the view by the developer utilizing Xcode. After design all UI components are connected, create bindings, to Swift code. This is a manual action performed by the developer. If the developer misses to bind a UI component, the app will crash with an nil pointer exception every time that view is exposed.

Storyboard for the tab views:

Storyboard for the sheetviews:

### RsyncUI and SwiftUI

*RsyncUI* utilizes SwiftUI for all UI parts. All UI components are views, which is a value type, a struct, and not a reference type, a class. All UI components are added to RsyncUI by code. Example of a view is the [Details view](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI/blob/main/RsyncUI/Views/Detailsview/DetailsView.swift) selecting the `DryRun` button.

The details view:
{{< image src="/images/Xcode/detailsview.png" alt="" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

 A  value type cannot be changed unless utilizing a mutating function. In  SwitfUI there are special property wrappers like `@State` and `@Binding` for local and private properties and properties for transferring data between views . There are property wrapper  like `@StateObject` which are of reference type. The latter property wrapper is initialized in the view as a class of type Observeable object. And there are many other property wrappers to be used within SwiftUI. RsyncUI utilizes only a few.

Every time like a property wrapper is changed the view in a SwiftUI based app is reloaded. By reload means the view is recreated by the runtime. The internal model for when to reload is complex, but it is superfast. The cost of creating a value type vs creating a reference type is way more effective.

## Asynchronous execution

Asynchronous execution of tasks are a key component of both apps. There are two methods for asynchronous execution. One is utilizing *callback functions* or *completion handlers*, which trigger next action when task is completed. The second is utilize SwiftÂ´s `async` and `await` utilities for asynchronous execution. Utilizing `async` and `await` makes the code simpler and cleaner. The need for *completion handlers* are reduced.  And lesser code is better code.

All code which utilizes asynchronous execution are shared between the two apps. The `Process` object is where the real work is done. Input to the `Process` are the command to execute and the parameters for the command. The `Process` object utilizes Combine for monitoring process termination and output, when needed by the apps, from the command.  There are two versions of the process object:

- [the process object](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/blob/master/RsyncOSX/RsyncProcess.swift)
- [the async process object](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/blob/master/RsyncOSX/RsyncProcessAsync.swift)

The difference between those two objects are minor, the async version marks the function for execution with keyword `async`. Calling the `async` require the `await` keyword.

## Combine

Combine, a declarative library by Apple, makes the code easy to write and easy to read. In the Combine code for encode and write data to JSON file, the publisher requiere **macOS BigSur** and later. Combine is utilized in the following parts of RsyncOSX and likewise for RsyncUI.

- [read](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/blob/master/RsyncOSX/ReadUserConfigurationJSON.swift) user configurations from permanent store
- [read](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/blob/master/RsyncOSX/ReadConfigurationJSON.swift) and [write](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/blob/master/RsyncOSX/WriteConfigurationJSON.swift) configurations
- [read](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/blob/master/RsyncOSX/ReadScheduleJSON.swift) and [write](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/blob/master/RsyncOSX/WriteScheduleJSON.swift) schedules and logs
- [the process object](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/blob/master/RsyncOSX/RsyncProcess.swift), executing tasks
- preparing [the output](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/blob/master/RsyncOSX/TrimTwo.swift) from rsync process
