The automatic feature of RsyncOSX is triggered by `⌘B` shortcut or by select the **double arrow**. RsyncOSX executes a --dry-run task for all configurations and executes a synchronize run only for tasks with data to be transferred or files to be deleted. The automatic backup can be aborted at any time.
