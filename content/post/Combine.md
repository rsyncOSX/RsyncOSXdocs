RsyncOSX **version 6.6.2** is released as an update for users on **macOS Big Sur**.

The major work in this release are **utilizing Combine** and only supporting **JSON files**. In development of [RsyncUI](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI), I "discovered" the new declarative framework Combine. Combine is also a great framework and makes the code easy to write and easy to read. It is most likely that RsyncOSX will avaliable for some years and why not upgrade RsyncOSX to utilize Combine.

There are though some restrictions. In the Combine code for encode and write data to JSON file, the publisher requiere macOS BigSur or later. This release will only be avaliable for **macOS BigSur** and later.

Much of the code where Combine is used is shared with RsyncUI. There is also some refactor and clean up other parts of the code in this release.

Combine is used in the following code:

- [read](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/blob/master/RsyncOSX/ReadUserConfigurationPLIST.swift) user configurations from permanent store
- [read](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/blob/master/RsyncOSX/ReadConfigurationJSON.swift) and [write](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/blob/master/RsyncOSX/WriteConfigurationJSON.swift) configurations
- [read](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/blob/master/RsyncOSX/ReadScheduleJSON.swift) and [write](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/blob/master/RsyncOSX/WriteScheduleJSON.swift) schedules and logs
- read and convert [configurations](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/blob/master/RsyncOSX/ReadConfigurationsPLIST.swift) and [schedules](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/blob/master/RsyncOSX/ReadSchedulesPLIST.swift) from PLIST format to JSON format
- [the process object](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/blob/master/RsyncOSX/RsyncProcess.swift), executing tasks
- preparing [the output](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/blob/master/RsyncOSX/TrimTwo.swift) from rsync process

The instructions below if for users who start version 6.6.0 and dont see any configurations. Configurations in PLIST format must be converted to JSON.

## Prepare for use

**Caution**: always do a backup of the configuration files before following the steps below. See [the settings](/post/userconfiguration/) for backup.

Check the About (in RsyncOSX) where RsyncOSX stores the configfiles:
```bash
/Users/thomas/.rsyncosx/macserialnumber
```

If you dont see any configurations after start?

In the file menu choose Convert, then choose Convert again and the magic happens. RsyncOSX will **terminate itself** after conversion of files. Restart and files are converted.
