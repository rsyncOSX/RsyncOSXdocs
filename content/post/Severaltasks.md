There are three options for executing several synchronize tasks. The three toolbar buttons are:

Search for all tasks with files to synchronize and execute.

![](/images/RsyncOSX/master/synchronize/backupnow.png) or by `⌘B` shortcut

Do an estimation run and present which tasks with files to be synchronized.

![](/images/RsyncOSX/master/synchronize/quickbackup.png) or by `⌘T` shortcut

As above, but for the selected tasks.

![](/images/RsyncOSX/master/synchronize/batch.png) or by `⌘R` shortcut

A **double click** on a task executes an estimation run and shows the result of the estimation.
