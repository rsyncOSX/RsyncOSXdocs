My name is Thomas and I am the developer of RsyncOSX. The development of RsyncOSX commenced in January 2016 as a project to learn Swift. The first version was released in March 2016 and I have learned a lot since then. The codebase for RsyncOSX today is very different from the very start. There has been a few refactor of code and the status of codebase today is quite stable. I have a university degree in computing science, but I am **not** a professional developer.

A professional Swift developer would probably written the code somewhat different. To be a professional developer require, in my opinion, to be a full time developer. There are a few design patterns around but there is no such thing as a **silver bullet**. To be really good at adapting a pattern require, again in my opinion, a role as professional developer. In such a context I am only an amateur.

I will continue to improve, enhance and add new functions in RsyncOSX. It is fun to code and I would like all users of RsyncOSX to ask for new functions and enhancements. Testing is also a challenge and I am not able to test all parts in RsyncOSX ahead of new releases. Xcode supports automatic testing and there implemented a few testcases for RsyncOSX.

If you like using RsyncOSX please consider giving me a star on the GitHub repository. Every single star is a motivation for me to continue developing and keep the apps updated for the latest version of macOS.

### Applications

There are four MacOS applications:

- [RsyncOSX](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX) a GUI for rsync
- [The menuapp](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSXsched) for executing scheduled RsyncOSX tasks
- [RsyncGUI](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncGUI) an Apple Sandboxed version of RsyncOSX
- [RcloneOSX](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/rcloneosx) a GUI for rclone

All applications are compiled with support for macOS 10.11 - latest version of macOS.
