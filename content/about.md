My name is Thomas, e-mail: <thomeven@gmail.com>, and I am the developer of RsyncOSX and RsyncUI. The development of **RsyncOSX** commenced early in 2016 as a personal project to learn Swift. And the development of RsyncUI commenced late 2020 to learn SwiftUI. There are some more info about the development [here](/post/built/).

| App      | Lines of code | Swift files | Version 1.0 |
| ----------- | ----------- |   ----------- | -------- |
| RsyncOSX   | about 160K   | 130       | 14 March 2016 |	
| RsyncUI   | about 170K        | 170       | 6 May 2021 |
 
I have a master degree in computing science, but I am **not** a professional developer. I did my master in the days when Linux was released in 1991 and Internet became a public service. And a few years ahead of that, in 1989, the Web was invented at Cern.   

RsyncOSX and RsyncUI are not professional software. There is one developer only, me, and I am doing what I can to keep the applications as stable and user friendly as possible. Nor am I a UI designer and some user might find the UI complicated and less user friendly. The maintenance of RsyncOSX and RsyncUI will be one of my hobbies. As long as there are users of the apps I will continue the maintenance.  If you like using RsyncOSX or RsyncUI please consider giving me a star on the GitHub repository. Every single star is a motivation for me to continue developing and keep the apps updated for the latest version of macOS.

In May 2022 I retired from work at the age of 62. I am a passionate [photographer](https://gallerybythomas.netlify.app), nature and wildlife (birds) and love staying in the Norwegian mountains. Grand kids, photography, continue maintenance of my macOS applications and cross country skiing are keeping me busy.

## How are these pages built

Hugo, which is **static site** generator, is the web framwork serving these pages. The source for this web is hosted on GitHub. Netlify, which runs the web server, automatically picks up changes on the main branch and rebuilds the server. The Hugo theme used is another open source project hosted on GitHub. 

Every time I change or add pages I commit the changes to GitHub and Netlify automatically builds the new server in seconds.
