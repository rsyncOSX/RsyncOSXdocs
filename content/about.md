My name is Thomas and I am the developer of RsyncOSX and RsyncUI. The development of **RsyncOSX** commenced early in 2016 as a project to learn Swift. The work on the new **RsyncUI** commenced late in 2020 after some thoughts about what next? Should I learn a language like TypeScript and develop a multiplattform version of RsyncOSX or continue on the Apple plattform.

I did some investigating about multiplattform development and I did not manage to find out what should be the right tools for such an application. After some carefull thinking I decided stay on the Apple development plattform with Xcode, Swift and **SwiftUI**. SwiftUI is an amazing framework. I have also learned about another amazing framework, **Combine**.

Learning is important for me. It is important to keep your mind sharp. I have a masters degree in computing science, but I am **not a professional developer**. I did my master degree in the days when Linux was released in 1991 and Internet became a public service. And a few years ahead of that, in 1989, the Web was invented at Cern.   

For the moment I am a senior advicer at a university. I will, early in 2022 at the age of 62, retire from work. When I am retired I will spend more time with grand kids, photograpy and continue working on developing my macOS applications.

RsyncOSX and RsyncUI is **not** professional software. There is only one developer, me, and I am doing what I can to keep the applications as stable and userfriendly as possible. I am not a UI designer and some user might find the UI complicated and less userfriendly.

The development of RsyncOSX and RsyncUI will continue to be one of my prioritized hobbies. As long as there are users of the apps I will continue developing.  If you like using RsyncOSX or RsyncUI please consider giving me a star on the GitHub repository. Every single star is a motivation for me to continue developing and keep the apps updated for the latest version of macOS.

## Me

This is me on a cross country ski trip in the Norwegian mountains in April 2021. Another, for me, important activity is [outdoor life in the Norwegian mountains](https://toppturer.netlify.app/), summer and winter.
